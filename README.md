# TUTEL-Verilog Projects

This repository hosts a collection of Verilog example projects created during my internship at TÜBİTAK TÜTEL Integrated Circuit Design and Training Laboratory. Each project is an assignment given during the internship, designed to demonstrate practical applications of Verilog HDL.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the code in this repository might not be optimized and may not work in all environments or configurations. The examples are provided for educational purposes and may require modifications to work correctly in your specific setup.

## Features

- **Educational Material**: These projects serve as educational material for anyone learning or improving their knowledge in Verilog HDL.
- **Real-World Examples**: The assignments are based on real-world tasks that help in understanding the application of Verilog in integrated circuit design.

## Usage

The projects in this repository are primarily for educational purposes. They are written in Verilog HDL and can be used as references or for practice by anyone familiar with Verilog. To use these projects, simply clone the repository and open the files in any Verilog simulation tool like Vivado etc.

Browse through the directories to find different projects and their respective Verilog source files.

## How to Contribute
